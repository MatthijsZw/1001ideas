The repository belonging to [1001ideas.org](http://www.1001ideas.org).

I plan to implement as many of the ideas I have as possible. Any code I produce is under the MIT-license. Ofcourse code I include from others is under that specific license, I will try to be as clear about this as possible.

Anything that's not code, like texts and images is under [CC-by-NC](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/).
