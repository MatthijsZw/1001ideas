  <h1>Learn a language while reading a book</h1>
  <p>
    Learning a new language is fun. But sometimes difficult to get around to.
    Save time and have fun by learning a language while reading a book.
    You start in a language you're comfortable with, and right from the start some words will be in your 'target' language.
    Slowly, more and more words will be in your target language. You can read the translation, or listen to the word.
</p>
<p>
    Read the last sentence of the book completely in your new language!
